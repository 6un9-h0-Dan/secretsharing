<h1>Secret Sharing Escrow Protocol</h1>
<p><i>Like multisig escrow but it actually works!</i></p>

<p>The holy grail of escrow services is to be able to facilitate payments
and arbitrate disputes without having direct access to the funds.  This goal,
commonly called "multisig escrow", is trivial using the Shamir secret sharing
scheme.</p>

<p>The protocol is simple, and involves three parties: Alice, the buyer, Bob,
the seller, and Trent, the escrow service.</p>

<h2>Setup:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Trent creates a new bitcoin private key and address, and shares it with Alice.</li>
	<li>Alice transfers the escrowed funds to Trent's address.</li>
	<li>Trent splits the bitcoin address's private key into 3 parts, with 2 parts required to
	reconstruct the secret.</li>
	<li>Trent <b>PERMANENTLY</b> discards the private key.</li>
	<li>Trent distributes one key part to Alice, and <b>PERMANENTLY</b> discards it.</li>
	<li>Trent distributes one key part to Bob, and <b>PERMANENTLY</b> discards it.</li>
	<li>Trent retains one key part.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Outcomes:</h2>

<h3>Goods are received, Alice wishes to pay Bob.</h3>
<p>Alice sends her key part to Bob.  Bob now has two parts, reconstructs the private key,
and transfers the funds to his wallet.</p>

<h3>Goods are not received, Bob wishes to refund Alice</h3>
<p>Bob sends his key part to Alice.  Alice now has two parts, reconstructs the private key,
and transfers the funds to her wallet.</p>

<h3>Transaction is disputed, Trent wishes to refund Alice</h3> 
<p>Trent sends his key part to Alice.  Alice now has two parts, reconstructs the private key,
and transfers the funds to her wallet.</p>

<h3>Transaction is disputed, Trent wishes to pay Bob</h3>
<p>Trent sends his key part to Bob.  Bob now has two parts, reconstructs the private key,
and transfers the funds to his wallet.</p>

<h2>Properties of the Protocol</h2>
<p>Once Trent has distributed the key parts, he no longer has access to the funds.
With only one key part, Trent cannot reconstruct the private key.  Therefore, should Trent
become a malicious entity (such as by hostile server takeover), the funds cannot be seized
by Trent or anyone controlling the escrow service.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob never share their key parts with Trent, so Trent will never be able to
reconstruct the private key.</p>

<p>If the transaction is not in dispute, Alice can pay Bob without Trent being involved at all.</p>

<p>If the transaction is not in dispute, Bob can refund Alice without Trent being involved at all.</p>

<h2>Modifications</h2>
<p>If Trent is using a third-party secret splitting service, then the bitcoin private key
should be encrypted prior to being split.  The encryption key used is shared with Alice and
Bob, and <b>PERMANENTLY</b> discarded by Trent.  Then, Alice and Bob can still both be fund recipients,
Trent is still unable to seize the funds, and the secret splitting service never sees anything
but encrypted data (and is therefore also unable to seize the funds).</p>
